**SubTrack** is a new app that tracks all of your monthly subscriptions and expenses. Most people have a myriad of subscriptions to services including cloud storage, media streaming, digital magazines, music streaming, food prep services, shaving clubs and much more. It’s easy to lose track of which subscriptions you use or get stuck paying for a subscription after a free trial period has expired.  It’s also really easy to accumulate many subscriptions you don’t use, with several similar subscriptions overlapping without your knowing it.  With SubTrack, you don’t have to worry. You can program in your monthly subscriptions, as well as other expenses and get a good idea of what you spend your hard-earned money on month to month.

**Premise**
SubTrack satisfies the need for people to keep track of their monthly expenses.  With most subscriptions being digital these days -with no bills in the mail to remind you-it has become very easy to accumulate subscriptions that add up to a lot of money every month.  Furthermore, many people forget to cancel subscriptions before their free-trial periods and end up paying for services needlessly just because they failed to cancel in time.  

The flexibility of this application lets you keep track of common subscription services, as well as your own individual expenses to better see how you spend your money.  The eventual hope is that this app also lets you compare subscription services, look out for promotions and discounts and avoid having duplicate services that offer the same product.  There is also the capability of each user being able to make notes on their subscription experiences and to create custom alerts for subscription payment or cancellation deadlines.  

Each user creates their own account where they can easily add all the subscription data relevant to them.  Numerous  provided subscription services (Amazon Video, Dropbox, Netflix, etc.)  will be able to be selected from a menu, or if the service is not list, it can be added as a custom bill.  The user selects the category of service, recurring billing period and cost, and this information is stored in a database and rendered in numerous ways for a user to break down their expenses.
